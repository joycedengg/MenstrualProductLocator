## Overview
### Description
This app would allow college students to quickly find nearby menstrual products, whether they're in bathrooms on campus or donated by students who happen to have one in their backpack.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health
- **Mobile:** Mobile is extremely important since all users will need the fast convenience of logging in on their phone to quickly find a product.
- **Story:** Creates a community of people on campus who menstruate. Allows them to support each other by donating products to each other during their times of need. Rewards people for logging free products in bathrooms on the map, or for donating a product to someone.
- **Market:** Any college students on campus who menstruate.
- **Habit:** Students always log on whenever they need a product in a public area but do not have one
- **Scope:** Begin with focusing on implementing a map where users can log that they need a menstrual product in a certain building, or log free products in a certain bathroom. Later on, expand into providing resources about menstrual health and products
